These are highlight files for Nano Text Editor. They aren't the prettiest because of all the [:space:] which is required to seperate the single commands. But it's better than nothing!

1. Copy files to your /usr/local/share/nano/ (MAC) or /usr/share/nano/ (LINUX).
2. Verify permissions match other .nanorc files. Change if necessary.
3. From terminal type "nano ~/.nanorc"
4. Type "include /usr/local/share/nano/*.nanorc"
5. Test on specified file type.
